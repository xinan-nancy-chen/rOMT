# Regularized Optimal Mass Transport (rOMT) Applied in Glymphatic-Lymphatic fluid flows 
This project includes code for <br />
(1) rOMT algorithm <br />
(2) Lagrangian representation of Glymphatic Dynamics (GLaD) analysis <br />

where (1) runs the main rOMT model on the dataset and (2) post-processes the results from (1).<br />

For detailed mathematical derivation and explaination of (1), please go to https://github.com/xinan-nancy-chen/rOMT/tree/main/rOMT_code_details.pdf in the current folder.<br />

![pipeline](ppl.png)
This figure shows the pipeline of the project where step a is (1) and step b-f are (2).

## System Requirements
The code was mainly written and ran in Matlab (R2018a for rOMT algorithm and R2019b for post-processing), with a small section in GLaD analysis ran with Python 3.7.3. 

### Dependencies
#### Matlab
(a) NIfTI_analyze https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image for loading and exporting nifty files <br />
(b) vtkwrite https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47814-vtkwrite-exports-various-2d-3d-data-to-paraview-in-vtk-file-format for exporting mat to vtk format <br />
#### Python (only for post-processing)
numpy, scipy, dipy
#### Recommended Software for Visualization
(a) Amira 6.5.0 for speed map (may require purchase)<br />
(b) VisIt 3.0.2 for flux vectors (open source)<br />

## Demo
The original 3D MRI dataset (each of size 100x106x100 and in total 11 frames) is too time and memory-consuming to run on a typical desktop computer, so usually we put it on a CPU cluster with 40 cores. Even though it may lose lots of details and information, for the purpose of demonstration, we downsized the original sample data by 0.5 and reduced the data frames to 7. It takes about 70 minutes to run the sample data with default parameters on a computer with 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB memory. <br />

### Instructions

To run the rOMT algorithm:<br />
(1) Set data directory, model parameters etc. in ```getParams.m``` and set the same tag name in line 6 of ```driver.m```. You can skip this step by using the default parameters and tag name within.<br />
(2) Run ```driver.m```.<br />

You are expected to see output like the following (subject to changes dependent on the paramters in ```getParams.m```):<br />

```

To run post-processing:<br />
(1) Set directory in ```getParams.m```. Skip this step if you are processing the same rOMT output from the previous section.<br />
(2) Set the tag name you want to process in line 10 of ```getGLAD.m```. Skip this step if you are running in default.<br />
(3) Run ```getGLAD.m```.<br />

You are expected to see output like the following (subject to changes):<br />
```

Instructions:

pl_cur.mat has been saved at the current directory.
Directly run run_dipyQB_pl.py with Python also in this directory.
Results will be saved automatically.
Then come back to Matlab and press any key to continue.
